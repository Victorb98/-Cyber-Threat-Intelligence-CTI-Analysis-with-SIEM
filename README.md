# -Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-CTI-Analysis-with-SIEM
This project showcases my CTI skills by analyzing a simulated security incident on a SIEM dashboard. 🎯 I reconstructed an attack timeline from logs, identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and built a threat profile. This demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into actionable intelligence and highlights my hands-on experience. 🕵️‍♂️
