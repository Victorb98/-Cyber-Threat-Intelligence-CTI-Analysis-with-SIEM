Cyber Threat Intelligence CTI-Analysis-with-SIEM
This project showcases my CTI skills by analyzing a simulated security incident on a SIEM dashboard. üéØ I reconstructed an attack timeline from logs, identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and built a threat profile. This demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into actionable intelligence and highlights my hands-on experience. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
üìå Project: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Analysis with SIEM

**üß† Summary / What It Does**

This project showcases my ability to perform Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analysis by investigating a simulated security incident within a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) environment. Using a provided dashboard and a series of logs, I was able to piece together a chain of events, identify key indicators of compromise (IOCs), and build a comprehensive threat profile.

This project demonstrates a critical skill in modern cybersecurity: the ability to translate raw log data into actionable intelligence.

**‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Tech**

TryHackMe: The platform used for the simulated lab environment.

SIEM Dashboard: A simulated Security Information and Event Management tool for log analysis.

CTI Principles: Applying core concepts of threat intelligence, including the kill chain and threat profiling.

**üóÇÔ∏è Features**

Log Analysis: Successfully identified and interpreted key log entries related to a suspicious event.

Indicator of Compromise (IOC) Identification: Extracted critical data points like a malicious email address and a downloaded executable filename (flbpfuh.exe).

Threat Profiling: Used the gathered information to construct a clear picture of the attack vector.

Security Incident Response: Demonstrated an understanding of how to follow a timeline of events to investigate a potential breach.

**üñºÔ∏è The Incident Timeline**

These images provide a visual walkthrough of the incident, starting with the main SIEM dashboard and progressing to a detailed log of the events I analyzed.

The image below shows the step-by-step process of analyzing the SIEM alerts to identify the threat. By connecting the log entries, I was able to build a clear timeline of the incident, from the initial phishing email to the final action.

**üí° Threat Actor & IOCs**

This section dives deeper into the specific indicators of compromise and threat actor details I was able to extract directly from the SIEM logs. The diagram below illustrates the flow of the attack, and I've provided the key findings to answer the questions.

By correlating the log entries, I successfully identified the following:

Threat Actor Extraction IP Address: 91.185.23.222

Threat Actor Email Address: vipivillain@badbank.com

Malware Tool: flbpfuh.exe

**‚úÖ What I Learned**

This project was a fantastic opportunity to put theoretical CTI knowledge into practice. I learned to:

Synthesize Data: Transform a disparate collection of logs into a coherent narrative of a cyberattack.

Practice Critical Thinking: Move beyond simply reading logs to actively questioning and correlating data to find the root cause of an event.

Understand SIEM Functionality: Gain hands-on experience with how a SIEM dashboard is used to monitor and respond to security threats.

Build Confidence: Confidently analyze an incident from start to finish, culminating in the successful identification of the threat and its details.
